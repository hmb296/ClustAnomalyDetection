## Clustering-Based Anomaly Detection in Mixed-Type Medical Data

This repository contains code used for data loading, preproessing, and data analysis conducted for my thesis project.

The main scripts are:
* `0_data_load.ipynb` - for loading datasets from UCI ML Repository and Ehrapy.
* `1_preprocessing_procedures.R` - for adjusting datasets for the intended analyses.
* `2_experiments_full.R` - for running all experimental runs (can be set up for the clustering or single-cluster variant`.
* `3_results_tests.ipynb` - for statistical tests and visualisations of the results.
* `4_confirmatory_evaluation.R` - for the confirmatory evaluation ("case stude").

The other scripts are used within the main scripts to source functions or parts of the procedures.
